= I cannot view my Portfolio page =

2. If you cannot find 'Portfolio Template' in a list of available templates, then just copy it from '/wp-content/plugins/portfolio/template/' directory to your templates directory.

= How to use a plugin? =

1. Create necessary technologies using this page http://example.com/wp-admin/edit-tags.php?taxonomy=portfolio_technologies&post_type=portfolio
2. This is optional. Fill in this page http://example.com/wp-admin/edit-tags.php?taxonomy=portfolio_executor_profile&post_type=portfolio - create a profile of executor. Fill in 'Name' and 'Description' fields. 'Description' field contains link to a personal executor's page.
3. Choose 'Add New' from the 'Portfolio' menu and fill out your page. Set necessary values for the Technologies and 'Executors Profile' widgets.

= How to add an image? =

Use Wordpress meta box to upload images from URL or your local storage. Note that one image needs to be selected as 'Featured' - it will be main image of your Portfolio item.

= You have updated the plugin, the template was changed, but you want to get back everything as it was? What you should do?=

Sometimes when updating the plugin the templates of the the plugin are updated in the theme herewith the back ups for the old versions of the templates are performed. There will be the files `portfolio-post.php.bak` and `portfolio.php.bak`in the theme. It is necessary to compare the old files and the new files, implement the required changes in the new files form the old files.

= i get the error listed on subject line - Call to undefined function get_post_thumbnail_id() =

       the theme don't supports thumbnails. 
         functions.php       
`add_action( 'after_setup_theme', 'theme_setup' );`
`function theme_setup() { 
	add_theme_support( 'post-thumbnails' ); 
}`
    thumbnail   .

= I was wondering what determines the order of portfolio posts on the Portfolio page =
     'orderby'                        => 'menu_order',  menu_order  

    orderby (string) - Sort retrieved posts by parameter. Defaults to 'date'.
        'none' - No order (available with Version 2.8).
        'ID' - Order by post id. Note the captialization.
        'author' - Order by author.
        'title' - Order by title.
        'date' - Order by date.
        'modified' - Order by last modified date.
        'parent' - Order by post/page parent id.
        'rand' - Random order.
        'comment_count' - Order by number of comments (available with Version 2.9).
        'menu_order' - Order by Page Order. Used most often for Pages (Order field in the Edit Page Attributes box) and for Attachments (the integer fields in the Insert / Upload Media Gallery dialog), but could be used for any post type with distinct 'menu_order' values (they all default to 0).
        'meta_value' - Note that a 'meta_key=keyname' must also be present in the query. Note also that the sorting will be alphabetical which is fine for strings (i.e. words), but can be unexpected for numbers (e.g. 1, 3, 34, 4, 56, 6, etc, rather than 1, 3, 4, 6, 34, 56 as you might naturally expect).
        'meta_value_num' - Order by numeric meta value (available with Version 2.8). Also note that a 'meta_key=keyname' must also be present in the query. This value allows for numerical sorting as noted above in 'meta_value'. 

      

'order'=>'ASC',  'order'=>'DESC', - 

    'ASC' - ascending order from lowest to highest values (1, 2, 3; a, b, c).
    'DESC' - descending order from highest to lowest values (3, 2, 1; c, b, a). 

= i'm getting the following error: Fatal error: Call to undefined function get_post_thumbnail_id() =

This error says that your theme doesn't support thumbnail option, in
order to add this option please find 'functions.php' file in your
theme and add strings below to this file:

add_action( 'after_setup_theme', 'theme_setup' );

function theme_setup() {
    add_theme_support( 'post-thumbnails' );
}

After that your theme will support thumbnail option and the error
wouldn't display again.
